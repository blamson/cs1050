Peduocode:

General makeup of program:

Class Calculator{
	Variables:
	methodCounters
	totalCounter
	Scanner
	
	default constructor(){
		Sets stuff to default values. Does nothing else.	
	}

	printIntro(){
		print("This is a scientific calculator, you will have four operations to choose from shown below")
	}
	
	calc(){
		print(Show all options with corresponding letter)
		userInput = scanned input
		calculation = converted userInput to uppercase for less if statements
		bool = true
		
		print(enter your numbers)
		number1 = scannumber
		number2 = scannumber
		// comment: The number scanning can be done out here or in each if statement individually. 		
		
		while(bool = true){
			if (m)
			{
				do max stuff
				iterate max counter up
			}
			if else (n)
			{
				Do min stuff
				iterate min counter up
			}
			So on so forth for other methods.
			
			else (t)
			{
				bool = false
				this does nothing else
			}
		}
		probably return nothing. The counters are all we need to save and those are a part of the class. 
	}
	
	printReport(){
		print(a nice message with all the counter totals)
	}
	
	main(){
		new calculator mycalc
		printIntro
		calc()
		printreport
	}
}
